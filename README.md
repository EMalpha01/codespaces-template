# Codespaces Template for Python and PyTorch NLP Development

This repository is a **template** for setting up a development environment in **GitHub Codespaces** specifically tailored for **Python** and **PyTorch** NLP projects. The repository is pre-configured to include all necessary tools, extensions, and settings to streamline your workflow.

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to save time and effort when creating future Codespaces for Python-based NLP projects. Instead of manually installing VS Code extensions and setting up each project, this template automates the process through a `.devcontainer` setup. All you need to do is create new repositories using this template, and Codespaces will automatically be configured with the tools you need.

## List of VS Code Extensions

Below are the extensions included in this repository, along with their purpose:

### Essential Python Development:
1. **Python** (by Microsoft)  
   Core extension for Python development, including IntelliSense, linting, and debugging.

2. **Pylance** (by Microsoft)  
   Enhances the Python extension with fast and accurate type checking, auto-completion, and IntelliSense improvements.

3. **Jupyter** (by Microsoft)  
   Allows running Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code, useful for prototyping NLP models.

### PyTorch and Machine Learning:
4. **PyTorch Snippets** (by PyTorchSnippets)  
   Provides useful code snippets for common PyTorch tasks, like tensor operations and model creation.

5. **Torch Lens** (by Nathan Epstein)  
   A tool for inspecting and visualizing PyTorch models, helping with debugging and optimization.

6. **TensorBoard** (by Microsoft)  
   Enables visualization of training metrics such as loss and accuracy, crucial for monitoring deep learning models.

### Code Formatting and Linting:
7. **Prettier - Code Formatter** (by Prettier)  
   A customizable code formatter that ensures consistent code styling across the project.

8. **Black Formatter** (by joslarson)  
   A Python-specific code formatter that follows the `black` code style, a widely adopted Python standard.

9. **Python Docstring Generator** (by Nils Werner)  
   Automatically generates docstrings for Python functions and classes, improving code documentation.

### AI-Assisted Code Suggestions:
10. **GitHub Copilot** (by GitHub)  
   AI-powered code suggestions and auto-completions based on context.

11. **Tabnine AI Autocomplete** (by Tabnine)  
   Another AI-powered code autocompletion tool, particularly effective with Python and machine learning codebases.

### Collaboration and Code Quality:
12. **Live Share** (by Microsoft)  
   Enables real-time collaboration for pair programming and code reviews directly within VS Code.

13. **ESLint** (by Dirk Baeumer)  
   Provides linting capabilities for mixed environments, especially helpful if working with Python and web technologies.

### Source Control and GitHub Integration:
14. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (by GitHub)  
   Manage GitHub issues, review pull requests, and monitor projects directly from VS Code.

### Data Manipulation and Debugging:
15. **Kite Autocomplete AI Code** (by Kite)  
   Provides advanced autocompletion for Python libraries, including NLP and machine learning packages like NumPy and PyTorch.

16. **Pandas Notebooks** (by Alessandro Silva)  
   Helps visualize and manipulate datasets, a core task in most NLP projects.

17. **Python Test Explorer for Visual Studio Code** (by Little Fox Team)  
   Manages and runs Python tests, especially useful when debugging and ensuring NLP models behave as expected.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Creating a New Repository from This Template**:
   - When starting a new NLP project, click the **"Use this template"** button on this repository.
   - GitHub will create a copy of this repository for you to use in your new project.

2. **Setting Up GitHub Codespaces**:
   - Once you create a repository using this template, you can open it in **GitHub Codespaces**.
   - The environment will automatically install all the listed extensions and apply workspace settings through the `.devcontainer` setup.

3. **Customizing for Your Project**:
   - If your project requires specific Python dependencies, update the `requirements.txt` file in your new repository.
   - Add any additional VS Code extensions or settings as needed in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

4. **Post-Creation Command**:
   - The template includes a `postCreateCommand` that automatically installs dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Make sure to keep this file updated.

## Future Reminders

The purpose of this template is to **automate** the setup process for future Codespaces environments when working on Python-based NLP projects. It reduces the manual effort of installing extensions and configuring the environment each time a new repository is created.

If you ever modify your extension or tooling preferences, remember to update the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in this repository so that future projects are aligned with your latest preferences.
